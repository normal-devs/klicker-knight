# PlayerStateDescription

A PlayerStateDescription is a well formed string derived from the [RoomState](./roomState.md) (and consequently the [PlayerState](./playerState.md)).

[The game](../architecture/klickerKnight.md) will output the PlayerStateDescription
for the [Room](./room.md) that the player is currently in.
